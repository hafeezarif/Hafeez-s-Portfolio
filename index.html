        <p class="aboutmecontext"> My Name is Hafeez Arif. Currently, I am a student enrolled in a Georgia Tech boot-camp designed to help aid in a career in web development.
            Once graduated, I would have the skills and knowledge that are necessary in order to become a full-stack web developer, such as applying JavaScript,
            utilizing databases, employing browser based technologies, and much more! The reason why I took up coding and web development is fairly simple. In 
            taking advantage of the skills I am being taught, I can begin to aid in helping build the world to be a better place. My future projects will represent
            this ideal of mine, an idea that I will never abandon. (Will be adding more to this section in the future once I have many projects in line and understand
            web development better!)
